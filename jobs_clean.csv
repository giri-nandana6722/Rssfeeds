We are a distributed team, working remotely, on a product that will be used by engineers all over the world – the ability to work on your own, and ship working code is crucial.

You have a good understanding of a software development process that takes a user-centred approach.
You easily build an understanding of the user’s context and goals which will help you build the right solution that brings the biggest value to them.
You know how to transform ideas into working code – you are able to design a solution, get feedback, and write a prototype by yourself.
You are a self-driven individual who understands the power of feedback loops in making roadmap decisions and driving our product forward.
You are able to communicate the design decisions clearly in written and spoken English.
You enjoy working on complex solutions – Grafana is a highly technological solution and has avid followers who rely on it every day and care deeply about their workflows.
You have an active interest in the three observability pillars (Metrics, Logs and Traces) and how they come together to build a powerful workflow.
You’re familiar with being on-call and performing operations tasks like version checking and rollbacks.

We work with React as our framework, Typescript, Redux, and RxJS
Rendering libraries such as uPlot, D3.js, Lodash and OpenLayers

What we work on

The team collaborates on reviewing feature requests from the OSS community and our customer base, identifying high-level roadmap themes, and overall driving the direction of data visualisation together with observability at Grafana Labs.

35,Senior Independent UX/UI Designer,"A·Team is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for Senior Independent UX/UI Designers (along with developers & product managers) to team up with hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. 
After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $85MM+ since.
As part of A·Team, you can expect:

High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies sent your way; generally $90-$150/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, Pepsi, Walmart, Endeavor, Post News (the former CEO of Waze), the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.
Work alongside friends old & new: our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.
Full autonomy: say ""no"" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. 
Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings: for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.
Keep 100% of what you earn: if you charge $120/hr, you get $120/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on top of your rate.

How to apply:
Go here: https://build.a.team/remotivedesignerreferral + mention Remotive. We respect your time so the application is short. We're also much more interested in seeing what you've made, and excited to chat more if there’s a fit.
What you’ll do:


Once part of A.Team, you’ll regularly be invited to impactful missions that match your interests. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders, to fast-growing super-funded companies, to old school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would


Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team. 


You’ll be paid to scope it out, give the client options, guide strategy, and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction. 


Who A·Team is for:


Senior UX/UI Designers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy.


Those who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role, who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders.


The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work, but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work), bootstrapping a side project, or looking for their next big thing


Who A·Team is not for:


People looking for small gigs


Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites


Those still early in their careers (<4 years) and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet)


Our long-term vision:
A·Team is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builder. We call them ""unhirables"": people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to, but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small, autonomous, distributed expert teams. 
To help us secure amazing missions, we raised $60 million+ from Insight Ventures, Tiger Global, NFX, RocNation, along with the former CEO of Upwork, the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade, Apple's Global Head of Recruiting, YC Partner Aaron Harris, Wharton's Adam Grant, and Duke's Dan Ariely.

36,Senior Independent Software Developer,"A·Team is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for senior independent software builders to team up with hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. 
After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $85+ million since.
As part of A·Team, you can expect:

High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies sent your way; generally $90-$150+/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, Pepsi, Walmart, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/Insight/Tiger/etc.
Work alongside friends old & new: our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.
Full autonomy: say ""no"" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too.

How to apply:
Go here: https://build.a.team/remotivereferral + mention Remotive. We respect your time so the application is short. We're also much more interested in seeing what you've made, and excited to chat more if there’s a fit.
What you’ll do:


Once part of A.Team, you’ll regularly be invited to impactful missions that match your interests. Find the right pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders, to fast-growing super-funded companies, to old school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would


Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team. 


You’ll be paid to scope it out, give the client options, guide strategy, and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction. 


Who A·Team is for:


Senior software developers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy.


Those who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role, who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders.


The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work, but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work), bootstrapping a side project, or looking for their next big thing


Who A·Team is not for:


People looking for small gigs


Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites


Those still early in their careers (<4 years) and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet)


Our long-term vision:
A·Team is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builder. We call them ""unhirables"": people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to, but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small, autonomous, distributed expert teams. 
To help us secure amazing missions, we raised $60 million+  from Insight Partenrs, Tiger Global, NFX, RocNation, along with the former CEO of Upwork, the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade, Apple's Global Head of Recruiting, YC Partner Aaron Harris, Wharton's Adam Grant, and Duke's Dan Ariely.

56,"Senior Frontend Engineer, Grafana DataViz","This is a remote opportunity, and we are considering applicants from Canadian eastern time zones only.
The DataViz squad is part of the Frontend Team in Grafana.  We are responsible for the panels that visualise data in Grafana like Histogram, Time series, Geomap and Canvas.  Our mission is to make all data visualisation useful, performant, and beautiful so that Grafana’s users can make informed and confident decisions with their own data.
Come and join us if you’re passionate about anything and everything OSS, Grafana and Data Visualisation.
We are looking for teammates with the following skills

You are comfortable working in a remote-first company; communication is key. For us, working together means being collaborative, friendly, kind, and respectful. We value autonomy and enabling decisions over committees and red tape. You have at least a couple of years of experience as a front-end developer. We are a distributed team, working remotely, on a product that will be used by engineers all over the world – the ability to work on your own, and ship working code is crucial.
You are a confident software engineer who’s experienced with data transformation and visualisation (eg SQL, Pivot Tables, D3.js, Matplotlib or Jupyter Notebooks).
You have a good understanding of a software development process that takes a user-centred approach.
You easily build an understanding of the user’s context and goals which will help you build the right solution that brings the biggest value to them.
You know how to transform ideas into working code – you are able to design a solution, get feedback, and write a prototype by yourself.
You are a self-driven individual who understands the power of feedback loops in making roadmap decisions and driving our product forward.
You are able to communicate the design decisions clearly in written and spoken English.
You enjoy working on complex solutions – Grafana is a highly technological solution and has avid followers who rely on it every day and care deeply about their workflows.
You have an active interest in the three observability pillars (Metrics, Logs and Traces) and how they come together to build a powerful workflow.
You’re familiar with being on-call and performing operations tasks like version checking and rollbacks.

What we use

We work with React as our framework, Typescript, Redux, and RxJS
Rendering libraries such as uPlot, D3.js, Lodash and OpenLayers
We use Golang for code that needs to live on the backend

What we work on

The team collaborates on reviewing feature requests from the OSS community and our customer base, identifying high-level roadmap themes, and overall driving the direction of data visualisation together with observability at Grafana Labs.
Our business as usual includes raising and fixing bugs, developing and testing new features, trialling innovative ideas for our products, close collaboration with UX, contributing to design docs, and more.
We are also closely collaborating with other squads in order to enhance the Grafana user onboarding journey.

Churches use our tools to communicate and connect with their congregations, organize information, and coordinate events. We’re committed to building great products that solve real problems using web and mobile products.
Our team enjoys the flexibility of remote work, utilizing tools like Asana, Slack, Notion, and Zoom for collaboration. We gather quarterly at our main office in Carlsbad, CA, fostering our work relationships.
 
About the Work
Planning Center is seeking a highly skilled and experienced iOS Developer to join our team. This role focuses on developing and maintaining high-quality applications for iOS devices, ensuring a seamless user experience for our customers. The ideal candidate will have extensive experience in iOS development, with a deep understanding of Swift and Objective-C, and a proven track record of building large-scale mobile applications with a significant user base.
 
Responsibilities

Lead the charge in maintaining and expanding our flagship iOS products
Design and develop new features from the ground up, refine existing ones, and keep everything running smoothly
Keep our customers’ data safe and secure
Turn feature ideas into solid technical plans and execute them with small, well-tested GitHub pull requests
Mentor and collaborate with your designer and developer teammates
Dive into code reviews to ensure we’re all learning and producing top-notch code
Get your code ready for builds and releases on the Apple App Store
Continuously improve our tools for automated application build and release
Stay on the cutting edge of iOS features and figure out how they can make our apps even better
Investigate and fix bugs reported by our awesome support team
Use tools like Firebase Crashlytics and Xcode’s Instruments to diagnose and resolve errors
Join in on book and code clubs to keep growing and learning together
Work closely with a friendly, collaborative development team to reach our goals and deliver fantastic products

 
Who We Look For
The best fits for any role on the Planning Center team are people embodying our Core Values:
Engage with Humility – We actively participate with openness and receptiveness. We are ready to listen, learn, and speak thoughtfully and kindly—regardless of skill level, expertise, or place on the org chart.Invest In Our Team – We give our time and energy to our team’s success—improving collaboration with effective communication, making space for diverse perspectives, sharing knowledge, and asking questions.Do Our Best Work – We aspire to do our best possible work—continually looking for ways to improve the quality of our individual output and contribute to our team’s overall success and growth.Focus on Customer Impact – We advocate for our customer’s best interests in our decision-making—we can trace the goal of every project back to creating positive value for our customers.Think Holistically, Work Iteratively – We focus on taking practical steps towards our goals with an awareness of the broader context—thinking big, working small.
 
We believe the strongest teams comprise people with diverse backgrounds and experiences, and we are committed to cultivating that diversity here at Planning Center. We’re building an inclusive, supportive place for you to do your best work.
 
The Hiring Process
During the hiring process, you’ll have a chance to interact with several members of our team. We strongly encourage you to bring any questions to anybody you interact with. You’re interviewing us as much as we’re interviewing you.
 
The teammates you’ll encounter along the way:

Our Recruiting and Growth Strategist
A few of our Senior Engineering Managers
Several developers from the Mobile Team
The Mobile Engineering Manager you’ll report to

 
For equitable reasons, we typically provide candidates with a timeline for hiring, so they can plan accordingly and determine early on in the process whether or not they can afford to wait on us; however, this particular round will stay open until all positions have been filled. Should you be offered a position here, the hiring team will discuss a start date that fits your schedule.
 
Below is an outline of the steps in our hiring process.
 
Step One: Apply with a resume and cover letter. Your cover letter should speak directly to your interest in this position. We want to know what got you into mobile development, how your experience has set you up for success in this role, and why you want to join our team.  
(A word of caution for those using AI cover letters: When compared to the hundreds of other candidates who did the exact same thing, it becomes painfully obvious who took the AI first draft. If you’re going to use these tools, we ask that you use them well. Please give our recruiter something a bit more human to read.)
 Step Two: If selected to move forward, an invitation to an online coding assessment to get a rough understanding of your developer prowess and skills
Step Three: Initial “blind screen” with our recruiter to get to know one another and discuss work and culture
Step Four: Pairing and Technical Interview over Zoom with a few members of the team (we’ll discuss your work experience, methodologies, and you can ask lingering questions you have about us)
Step Five: Pending all goes well, we’ll extend an offer
 
Qualifications

Proven track record of publishing and maintaining large-scale iOS apps with a big user base
Expert-level skills in Swift and Objective-C
Experience with UIKit, Core Data, and other iOS frameworks
React Native experience is a nice bonus
Strong grasp of mobile architecture, design patterns, and best practices
Sharp problem-solving skills and keen attention to detail
Experience working closely with a collaborative team
Willingness to travel four times a year to connect with the team
You must reside and be eligible to work in the United States

80,Senior Independent UX/UI Designer,"A·Team is a VC-backed, stealth, application-only home on the internet for Senior Independent UX/UI Designers (along with developers & product managers) to team up with hand-picked, high-growth companies on their next big thing. 
After talking with hundreds of independent engineers, designers, and product folks, we heard over and over that finding vetted, high-quality, consistent clients is hard, and projects are often too small to be rewarding. A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $85MM+ since.
As part of A·Team, you can expect:

High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies sent your way; generally $90-$150/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, Pepsi, Walmart, Endeavor, Post News (the former CEO of Waze), the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.
Work alongside friends old & new: our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.
Full autonomy: say ""no"" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. 
Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings: for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.
Keep 100% of what you earn: if you charge $120/hr, you get $120/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on top of your rate.

How to apply:
Go here: https://build.a.team/remotivedesignerreferral + mention Remotive. We respect your time so the application is short. We're also much more interested in seeing what you've made, and excited to chat more if there’s a fit.
What you’ll do:


Once part of A.Team, you’ll regularly be invited to impactful missions that match your interests. Take your pick from early-stage incubations with world-class founders, to fast-growing super-funded companies, to old school non-tech incumbents looking to build as a tech giant would


Missions usually involve building an ambitious piece of software from 0 to 1 as part of a small 3-4 person team. 


You’ll be paid to scope it out, give the client options, guide strategy, and execute on the selected solution. Sometimes the client has a clear vision, sometimes not; which is why A.Team builders tend to be senior folks who can work together to find the right direction. 


Who A·Team is for:


Senior UX/UI Designers who left large companies and high-growth startups to pursue their craft with autonomy.


Those who prefer consistent contract work over a full-time role, who want to create a variety of new products alongside other top-tier builders.


The majority of A.Teamers spend most of their time doing independent work, but a sizeable percentage are either employed full-time (but testing out client work), bootstrapping a side project, or looking for their next big thing


Who A·Team is not for:


People looking for small gigs


Folks looking to build simple wordpress/wix/squarespace-style websites


Those still early in their careers (<4 years) and recent university/bootcamp grads (at least not yet)


Our long-term vision:
A·Team is a new type of company for a new kind of independent software builder. We call them ""unhirables"": people who traditional companies couldn’t hire full-time even if they wanted to, but who want to do their most meaningful work with their favorite people in small, autonomous, distributed expert teams. 
To help us secure amazing missions, we raised $60 million+ from Insight Ventures, Tiger Global, NFX, RocNation, along with the former CEO of Upwork, the founders of Fiverr and Lemonade, Apple's Global Head of Recruiting, YC Partner Aaron Harris, Wharton's Adam Grant, and Duke's Dan Ariely.

1168,"A ""Perfect"" Stranger","Think about it this way. A person you've never met -- a connection through a friend of a follower--emails you out of the blue to request that you send a copy of their resume to your HR Department. They explain that they are applying for a job with your employer and would like some help. It's a simple request, so would you do it?

What this person is asking makes a lot of sense, especially in these days and times. They want to stand out from the crowd. There's just one problem -- they don't stand out in your mind. You have no idea who they are. So, their request isn't as simple as it first appears to be. They want you to take the time and assume the risk of passing along the resume of a ""perfect"" stranger.

Now granted, your time investment may, at least at first blush, be trivial. All you have to do is forward their message (and attached resume) on to someone in HR. But still, they've interrupted your train of thought, and that act has a cost that is greater than you may realize. Research now shows that it typically takes a person about 25 minutes to get back on track when they are interrupted by an outside communication. As overloaded as most of us are these days, even that modest a break in your rhythm can really set you back.","{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': '', 'value': '<p>Think about it this way.
